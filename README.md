# About This Project
This project entitled **"Easy-Medicine"**, has been designed to streamline the process of 
managing a pharmacy and to make it easier to do the tasks. Some of the functions it will 
contain is have a billing system and a system to control and keep track of the inventory of 
medicines. 

It is designed to be used by 2 users, the pharmacist and the assistant or cashier. The person 
in control is decided by the login information of the employee. If the assistant or cashier is 
logging in, then they can only make use of the billing system as they are not qualified to 
interact with the inventory. 

If the pharmacist logs in, they can access and use both the billing system and manage the 
inventory database. 

When using the billing system all the medicine present in the database will show as a drop
down list so you can choose instead of typing it and the price for one will also be 
automatically displayed and all the user has to do is enter the quantity of items chosen. 

It will be capable of keeping count of how many of each medicine is in the inventory and 
deduct the quantity as sales take place. When using the inventory function, it will consist of
a user-friendly interface where you can view all the medicines and also add and remove 
them. 
It will also be capable of generating reports on various topics such as the payment history 
for a specific time period or get the purchase history of a particular customer. 

The Easy-Medicine application will be created using VB.NET for the front end and MySQL 
for backend.
